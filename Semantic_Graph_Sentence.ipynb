    "# Introducing the Semantic Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "_This notebook is part of a tutorial series on [txtai](https://github.com/neuml/txtai), an AI-powered semantic search platform._\n",
    "\n",
    "[txtai](https://github.com/neuml/txtai) executes machine-learning workflows to transform data and build AI-powered semantic search applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main use cases of txtai is semantic search over a corpus of data. Semantic search provides an understanding of natural language and identifies results that have the same meaning, not necessarily the same keywords. Within an Embeddings instance sits a wealth of implied knowledge and relationships between rows. Many approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) indexes are even backed by graphs. What if we are able to tap into this knowledge?\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic graphs, also known as knowledge graphs or semantic networks, build a graph network with semantic relationships connecting the nodes. In txtai, they can take advantage of the relationships inherently learned within an embeddings index. This opens exciting possibilities for exploring relationships, such as topics and interconnections in a dataset. \n",

      "3433 {'text': 'As, the United States moves to reshape the geopolitical terrain of the world, \\'Nith hundreds of military bases in 130 countries added to hundreds of installations stretched across its own territorial confines, the vast majority of Americans refuse to admit their nation possesses anything resembling an Empire. Yet U.S. global expansion is far more ambitious than anything pursued or even imagined by previous imperial powers. It might be argued that the \"new militarism\" is rooted in a \"new imperialism\" that aspires to nothing short of world domination, a project earlier outlined by its exuberant proponents and given new life by the Bush II presidency, which has set out to remove all vestiges of ideological and material impediments to worldwide corporate power-by every means at its disposal. It is hard to resist the conclusion that the United States, its strong fusion of national exceptionalism, patriotic chauvinism, and neoliberal fundamentalism fully in place, has evolved into something of an outlaw, rogue state--the kind of fearsome entity conjured up by its own incessant propaganda. Celebrations of power, violence, and conquest long associated with warfare inevitably take its architects and practitioners into the dark side of human experience, into a zone marked by unbridled fanaticism and destructive ventures requiring a culture of lies, duplicity, and double standards. Militarism as a tool of global power ultimately leads to a jettisoning of fixed and universal values, the corruption of human purpose, the degradation of those who embrace it, and finally social disintegration. As Chris Hedges writes in liVtzr Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning: \"War never creates the society or harmony we desire, especially the harmony we briefly attain during wartime.\"1 Here the critical observer is entitled to ask whether the staggering costs and consequences of U.S. imperial domination can possibly be worth any of the goals or ideals invoked as their political justification. We seem to have reached a point where U.S. leaders see themselves as uniquely entitled to carry out warfare and imperial agendas simply owing to the country\\'s status as the world\\'s lone superpower and its preponderance of military force. In the wake of 9/11 and the onset of Bush\\'s war against terrorism, the trajectory of U.S. militarism encounters fewer limits in time and space as it becomes amorphous and endless, galvanized by the threat of far-flung enemies.As at the height of the cold war, the power structure embellishes an image of the globe where two apocalyptic forces-good versus evil, civilized versus primitiv~e locked in a batde to the death. U.S. expansionism is thereby justified through its quest, its apparent need, for an increase in both domestic and global power-a quest destined to bring the superpower to work against even its own interestsc Empires across history have disintegrated on the shoals of their boundless elite hubris, accelerated by global overreach, internal decay, and collapse oflegirimacy, and there is little reason to think that Pax Americana will be able to avoid the same fate. While a feverish nationalism might sustain elite domestic legitimacy temporarily, it cannot secure the same kind of popular support internationally, any more than could a United States-managed world economy that sows its own dysfunctions in the form of mounting chaos, poverty. and inequality. To the extent the United States is determined to set itself above the rest of the world, brandishing technologically awesome military power and threatening planetary survival in the process, it winds up subverting its own requirements for international stability and hegemony. In a perpetual struggle to legitimate their actions, American leaders invoke the familiar and trusted, but increasingly hollow, pretext of exporting democracy and human rights. With the eclipse of the Communist threat, U.S. foreign policy followed the path of \"humanitarian intervention,\" cynically employing seductive motifs like multiculturalism, human rights, and democratic pluralism-all naturally designed for public consumption. Few knowledgeable observers outside the United States take such rhetoric seriously, so its propagandistic merit is confined mainly to the domestic sphere, although even here its credibility is waning. \"Democracy\" becomes another self-serving facade for naked U.S. geopolitical interests, even as its popular credibility has become nearly exhausted, all the more with the fraudulent claims invoked to justify the war on Iraq. Strikingly, the concept of democracy (global or domestic) receives litde critical scrutiny within American political discourse, the mass media, or even academia; the de~ocratic ~umanitarian motives of U.S. foreign policy have become an arncle of fa.tth, and not just among neoconservatives. Yet even the most cursory inventory of the postwar historical record demonstrates a pervasive legacy of U.S. support for authoritarian regimes across the globe and a rathe_r flagr~t contempt for democracy where it hinders (imputed) nanonal mterests. Throughout the Middle East and Central Asia the United States has established close ties with a variety of dictators and monarchs willing to collaborate with American geopolitical and neoliberal agendas. The recent armed interventions in the Balkans, Mghanistan, and Iraq have left behind poor, chaotic, violence-ridden societies far removed from even the most generous definition of pluralist democracy. The case of Iraq is particularly instructive. Framing \"preemptive\" war as a strike against Saddarn Hussein\\'s tyranny and for \"liberation;\\' the Bush administration-its assertions regarding terrorist links, weapons of mass destruction, and inuninent Iraqi military threats shown to be liesscandalously trumpets the old myths while corporate boondoggles become more transparent by the day.

       "1. First, there was a separation or break in time - the contrast between a modern now and a traditional, backward past, so that the societies of the Third World were located in another, previous time and their co-presence in modern time was effectively erased (Fabian 1983). <br/><br/>Use of the term modernization is a blanket to cover colonization <br/><br/>Slater 2004 (David, Professor of Social and Political Geography at Loughborough University, “Geopolitics and the Post-colonial: Rethinking North-South Relations”, p 57-58)<br/><br/>Modernization theory provided post-war society in the West, and especially the US, with a temporal and spatial identity, an identity that could only be effectively constructed in a relation of difference with another time and another space. In this sense the will to be modern designated two forms of separation. First, there was a separation or break in time - the contrast between a modern now and a traditional, backward past, so that the societies of the Third World were located in another, previous time and their co-presence in modern time was effectively erased (Fabian 1983). Second, there was a separation in space - a geopolitical distinction made between the modern societies of the West and the 'traditional societies' of Africa, Asia and Latin America. These processes of separation were seen as being accompanied by transformations in science, technology, administration and economy, which were portrayed as opening up the future to limitless advancement and improvement (Adas [ 990, Latour 1993). The second kind of separation which reflected the existence of a geopolitical divide was further accentuated by the emergence of the Cold War, which gave a new kind of conflictual significance to the spatial separation between the modern and traditional spheres of world development. . Sakai (1997), in a discussion of the universal and the particular, Illuminates significant facets of the connection between the modern! non-modern difference and geopolitics. Thus, while we may wish to keep in mind that the modern has always been opposed to its historical precedent, the pre-modern, geopolitically the modern has been contrasted to the non-West, so that a historical condition is translated into a geopolitical one and vice versa. Although the West is particular in itself, it has been constructed as the universal point of reference through which others arc encouraged to recognize themselves as particularities. In the context of post-war modernization theory, the particular universality of the West came to be founded in a process of Americanization, so that as Sakai (1997: 157) puts it, whereas, in the pre-I 940 period the process of modernization had been the approximate equivalent of Europeanization, after the Second World War, modernization theory was deployed in a way that reflected the shifting of the centre of geopolitical gravity from Western Europe to the United States. The emphasis on modernization in the United States can be interpreted as a reflection of a new ethos of national purpose. Emerging at the end of the Second World 'War as the key Western power, there was a sense within the US that its burgeoning power was the result of the combination of its scientific and technological prowess, its military capacity, its democratic and open traditions and its expansive modernity. The US was the world's number one modern nation with a way of life that other less advanced nations would benefit from following and adopting. In its economic, political and cultural spheres, the US was seen as being ahead of other nations, as the nation that could and should offer leadership to the world. Its contemporaneity, rationality, innovation, dynamism, opportunity, mobility and freedom - in a nutshell, its modern being - was a beacon to the world. But there was another factor which helps to explain the focus on modernization in the context of West/non-West encounters. The term 'modernization' would, according to Walt Rostow, leading economist and deputy national security advisor, replace colonialism and create a 'new post-colonial relationship between the northern and southern halves of the Free World' in which a 'new partnership among free men- rich and poor alike' would emerge (quoted in Latham 2000: 16). Modernization would be conceptualized as a benevolent and universal process, a process based on a certain reading of Western and especially US experience, an experience in which US imperialism was erased, and this process would be framed as being necessary for the modernization and development of non-Western societies, especially relevant in a period in which many of these societies, in particular Africa and Asia, were undergoing a process of rapid decolonization. The term 'modernization' had a positive, progressive, and seductive orientation- to be against modernization would be tantamount to being irrational, backward, and retrogressive.<br/><br/>2. There was a specificity about this intersection which contrasts with earlier and later periods and needs to be understood in its geopolitical and historical context. <br/><br/>The projection of power portrayed of the US gave them an entitled sense of superiority. The American ideas of “modernization” are all really outgrowths of what we believed to be progress.<br/><br/>Slater 2004 (David, Professor of Social and Political Geography at Loughborough University, “Geopolitics and the Post-colonial: Rethinking North-South Relations”, p 57-58)<br/><br/>As we have seen in the previous chapter, the emergence of the United States as a global power went together with a projection of notions of civilization, progress, democracy and order that posited a subordinate place for the societies of the non-West. The powers of expansion and intervention, both internally in the territorial constitution of the United States itself, and in a broader transnational mission of Empire, were intimately rooted in a vision of the United States as a driving force of Western civilization, diffusing its values to the presumed benefit of other non-Western societies (Cumings 1999). However, while US-modeled notions of civilization, progress, democracy and order continued to be transmitted in the period after the Second World War, and remained part of the Americanizing mission, other concepts came to receive greater emphasis. From the 1950s onward notions of 'modernization' and 'development' came to be more closely associated with the portrayal of West/non-West encounters, whereas representations of civilization and order, although still present, as noted above in the Dulles quotation, became less prominent - they were no longer the master signifiers they had been before 1940. At the same time, democracy and order were resituated in a discursive context organized around the new signifiers of modernization and development. This does not mean, of course, (hat these terms had never been deployed before the Second World War, but rather that their visibility and discursive weight came to assume greater predominance in the post-War period. The post-War origins of the 'discourse of development' have been dealt with in considerable detail by Escobar (1995), while Patterson (1997) has traced the links between notions of Western civilization and modernization. Also, recent contributions (for example, Baber 2001 and Blaney & Inayatullah 2002) have revisited modernization theory in relation to Cold War politics and the conceptualization of international relations. What therefore still needs to be examined; or more precisely, what constitutes my own perspective? First, in analyzing the continuing intersections between geopolitical power and the cultural representations of other, non-Western societies, and particularly Latin America in the example of this study, it is important to keep in mind that the notion of modernization - or more specifically modernization theory - came to be closely associated with the nature and direction of US interventions in the Third World in the 1950s and 1960s. There was a specificity about this intersection which contrasts with earlier and later periods and needs to be understood in its geopolitical and historical context. It not only provides another important example of the interwoven nature of power, politics and representation but also illustrates the changing dynamic of US power as it impacted on the Third World. Second, from a post-colonial perspective, and in the specific setting of this chapter, there are two analytical elements that can be usefully signaled: a) The power to intervene was certainly not unaffected by the societies in which that invasive power was projected, since, as was noted in the previous chapter, resistances and oppositions US hegemony altered the subsequent modalities of intervention, and this was particularly the case with respect to both the Cuban Revolution of 1959 and the Vietnam War, set as they were in a broader context of accelerating geopolitical turbulence. b) The geopolitics of intervention situated as it was in a Cold War context had an inside and an outside, since the Cold War had its chilling effect on domestic politics in the United States itself, and the phenomenon of 'containment culture' was a reflection of the interweaving of international and national concerns. Third, modernization as an idea, and its association in the 1950s and 1960s with Americanization, was not new (Ceasar 1997: 168), and nor was it to disappear after the 1970s-. As will be further shown in the next chapter, there are connections between neo-liberalism and modernization theory, as well as significant and often neglected differences. Furthermore, the term 'modernization' is frequently invoked today as if it had no history, and so in my own discussion an important objective is to highlight the historical specificity of the modernization idea in the Cold War era as ·part of a counter-geopolitics of memory. In this chapter, I shall argue that the Occidental, and predominantly US enframing and deployment of modernization theory for the 'developing world' was a reflection of a will to spatial power. It provided a legitimation for a whole series of incursions and penetrations that sought to -subordinate, contain and assimilate the Third World as other. In the process it also put into place a vision of the West, and especially of the United States, which in some important aspects was re-asserted in later neo-liberal delineations of modern development, as well as in subsequent writings on globalization.<br/><br/>3. It was followed by the imposition of the use of the rulers' own patterns of expression, and of their beliefs and images with reference to the supernatural. <br/><br/>The assumed cultural norms of economic engagement entrenches a universal market aesthetic reenacting a pattern of domination inherent in colonial thought. <br/><br/>Quijano 2007 (Aníbal, PhD National University of San Marcos Peru, “COLONIALITY AND MODERNITY/RATIONALITY,” Cultural Studies, volume: 21, 1, pg. 169,JC)<br/><br/>In the beginning colonialism was a product of a systematic repression, not only of the specific beliefs, ideas, images, symbols or knowledge that were not useful to global colonial domination, while at the same time the colonizers were expropriating from the colonized their knowledge, specially in mining, agriculture, engineering, as well as their products and work. The repression fell, above all, over the modes of knowing, of producing knowledge, of producing perspectives, images and systems of images, symbols, modes of signification, over the resources, patterns, and instruments of formalized and objectivised expression, intellectual or visual. It was followed by the imposition of the use of the rulers' own patterns of expression, and of their beliefs and images with reference to the supernatural. These beliefs and images served not only to impede the cultural production of the dominated, but also as a very efficient means of social and cultural control, when the immediate repression ceased to be constant and systematic."

In theory, governments are supposed to police corporate greed, channeling it . . . away from the corner-cutting that threatens public health and safety. But regulation is an iffy thing. Corporations are constantly pressuring governments to relax environmental regulations if not eliminate them altogether. This pressure is often supplemented by bribery— most commonly, the legal bribery known as campaign contributions, which has turned so many politicians in the United States into spineless corporate supplicants unwilling to bite the hands that feed them. . . . Capitalism needs and promotes ceaseless expansion, yet the evidence that human activity is already overwhelming the earth’s ecosystems is all around us.”40 Also overwhelmed is the capacity of environmental efforts to cope.',\n",

Borders help constitute the way we conceive the world. <br/><br/>These exclusionary borders help reinforce this epistemology inherent in the us/them dichotomy that leads to the otherization of anyone that is on the “outside”<br/><br/>Sanchez and Sholar ’12 [December 2012, Peter, PhD Loyola University Chicago, and Megan, PhD Loyola University Chicago, “Power and Principle: A New US Policy for Latin America”, http://www.ijhssnet.com/journals/Vol_2_No_23_December_2012/3.pdf]<br/><br/>We can ﬁrst observe that borders help fulﬁl epistemological conditions. Borders produce particular conditions for understanding ‘reality’. We who¶ are inside the border are also expected to possess greater knowledge of insiders than of outsiders, which in turn reduces uncertainties regarding our common knowledge on the inside. The border is frequently a bulwark sustaining commonly agreed measures of reality (such as national-currency measures for inﬂation or relative welfare). The border slices the world up into different pieces of reality that we cannot know equally well. That increases as well the plausibility of any assertion regarding the circumstances, gains or losses within our border. Hence, other things being equal, borders help promote the idea that there are fewer uncertainties in communications between insiders by comparison with communications with those on the outside. This leads to an assumption that we will be able to agree on the terms used to evaluate changes and preferences – even the order of priorities, which is a pre-condition of political decisions. Put in a nutshell, the border provides conditions for greater certainty and agreement for those within it. Thompson also makes explicit an ontological claim for the border/boundary which is implicit in post-structuralism’s prioritisation of dif- ferences as against commonalities: namely, that ‘...borders exist “before” entities ...’ – that is to say, borders are ontologically prior to speciﬁc enti- ties. Borders help constitute the way we conceive the world. This can be demonstrated, inter alia, on the basis of the epistemological claims above. For those epistemological consequences of boundaries provide key onto- logical pre-conditions for the continuity of the given social particular as an integrated entity; and hence also for its identity.14 The ‘fact’ of the border helps produce shared understandings of the identities of particulars, both internal and external to the particular itself. This includes understandings of internal variations and sub-categories (constituencies, classes ... ) between insiders/members of the given social particular. The self-identities of mem- bers and sub-categories are grounded in, and thus far validated, by seeing those particulars in relation to each other.15 Likewise, the boundary sustains any determination of the collectivity (the ‘nation’, or whatever it may be) whose interests may be the basis for decisions and actions on its behalf. This, as Rokkan noted,16 is especially signiﬁcant in democratic collectivities, where a large self-aware demos is postulated as the ground for decisions that need to accord in some way with the preference of an indeterminable category, the ordinary mass of the people. The above ontological effects of borders yield yet further consequences. For borders provide pre-conditions for determinations of the situation of insiders relative to outsiders: claims regarding presumed and/or potential different conditions (be it better or worse) for insiders than for outsiders.17 The same could be said of any impression of greater/lesser (or poten- tially greater/lesser) welfare than outsiders. Only with these kinds of claims and impressions in place, can an additional, politically important category of knowledge have meaning: assertions about potential improvements or¶ deteriorations in conditions for the inside.18 If the existence of the subjects who experience comparative well-being were not given, we would not ﬁnd meaning in headlines such as ‘Danish schools worst on PISA tests’.19 A fortiori threats which it may be necessary to protect against.<br/><br/>2.

Our goal, nevertheless, is to point out that in a hegemonic system an intersection exists between policies based on selfish interest and ethical considerations. For a great power to be accepted as a hegemon, it must act in ways that provide key benefits to subordinate states, principally democracy, peace, and security. If not, the great power will rely solely on force, rather than leadership, to achieve influence. Therefore, and perhaps ironically, an ethical US policy toward Latin America can better protect vital US interests than a purely realist policy. We will point out, as other scholars have done, that selfish US policies in the past have often been counterproductive in the long run, jeopardizing, rather than protecting, vital long-term interests. But our argument is not the classic conflict between liberalism and realism; rather, it is a recognition that the realist calculus changes when a Great Power becomes a hegemonic power. Nevertheless, if we can show that an ethical policy can preserve US interests more effectively than a policy based purely on selfish, immediate interests, then we can move closer to the acceptance of a policy that is increasingly ethical and help to bridge the gap between two key schools of thought in American foreign policy—realism and liberalism (Harries, 2005).¶ Moving beyond criticism, we then propose several concrete changes to US policy that would enhance America’s ethical stance toward Latin America, thereby enhancing US hegemony. In essence we provide a prescription that shows how a Great Power’s policies should change once it becomes a hegemonic power. These modest policy recommendations, if enacted, would preserve US interests by improving America’s image, an also result in enhanced security, democracy, and prosperity in the western hemisphere. Taking these steps is important for the United States because Latin America remains a vital region for US strategic, geopolitical, and economic interests (Hsiang, 2003, 59-60). If Washington cannot secure its key interests and be perceived positively in the Western Hemisphere, then attaining goals in the rest of the world will be a pipe dream.<br/><br/>3. Latin America abounds in natural resources and must take measures to protect <span style='background-color: #fff59d'>them.</span> <br/><br/>US-Latin American Relations key to Democracy, Climate change, alternative energies, and S&T<br/><br/>Bitar, ’11 [September 2011, Sergio Bitar, a long-time member and now non-resident senior fellow of the Inter-American Dialogue.Bitar served as senator as well as minister of energy and mines, education, and public works under three separate administrations in Chile, “Latin America and the United States: Looking Towards 2020”, http://www.thedialogue.org/PublicationFiles/LAtheUS2020.pdf]<br/><br/>New opportunities for US-Latin America Relations: Which Partnerships? To prepare new partnerships it is important to have in mind the three processes already reviewed: prevailing global trends, US government policies and the status of the US economy, and priorities that Latin American governments are ready to carry out. The United States faces years of constraints. It will have to devote greater resources to preserving the competitive and technological edge that is critical to maintaining its influence. It is likely that Latin America—especially South America—will continue to multiply its exchanges with Asia over the next five years. Rates of investment and the expansion of the middle class in China, India, and other middle-income countries will drive global growth through expanded domestic consumption. Latin America will account for a larger share of the demand for products than industrialized countries. In this global context, the United States will be closely following events in Latin America—as a market, an energy supplier, and a region with which it shares problems and opportunities. Most US attention will focus on Mexico and Brazil, albeit for different reasons and with different emphases. Mexican markets, oil resources, and migrants have a strong impact in the United States. Mexico and the United States need to work closely together in combating drugs and organized crime. Brazil will draw high levels of US attention because of its rising global role, expanding market, industrial progress, and the production of oil, food and biofuels. Immigration will continue to be necessary for the United States to sustain its growth. Negative aspects of immigration tend to grab the spotlight, but the fact remains that Latin American immigrants make a major contribution to the US economy. A recent report5 projects that the US population will increase from 310 million in 2010 to 370 million in 2030, half of it as a result of immigration. This would make the United States the only industrialized country to have population growth through 2030. Leaving aside Brazil and Mexico–whose size will make them increasingly important actors–the rest of the countries should cooperate and coordinate with one another more effectively to have some influence on global political and economic trends. The expanding role of Brazil and Mexico is guaranteed by their sheer size. But smaller Latin American countries must seek closer cooperation and coordination to enhance their influence.Each will take the initiative and seek mutually beneficial arrangements with the United States. As a start, three areas are worth pursuing: democracy strengthening; energy and climate change; and education, science, and technology. Democracy Strengthening a) In Central America, collaboration could bolster the fight against organized crime, improve citizen security, and strengthen democratic institutions.The United States has proposed a Central America Citizen Security Partnership. High levels of drug consumption and arms sales to countries south of the border give the United States a special responsibility in this regard. Mexico and Colombia can also make an important contribution, while South America can cooperate in security, crime investigation, police training, and other initiatives. b) South American nations should get more involved in providing assistance to Haiti. c) The region should also offer support to help facilitate a transition to democracy in Cuba. Despite the steps taken by the Obama administration regarding visits and remittances, the ineffective US embargo continues with no end in sight. For Latin Americans, it will be important to have conditions in place for a peaceful transition when Cuban leadership changes. It is helpful to encourage some processes underway in Cuba, such as the release of political prisoners, improved freedom of expression, and economic reforms, which could pave the way for a democratic opening. Energy and Climate Change Although President Obama has spoken about an Energy and Climate Partnership of the Americas, its content, priorities, goals, and resources remain unclear. a) There are opportunities for collaboration in developing renewable energy sources, especially solar, and assisting with nuclear plant safety and ethanol, cleaner coal, and natural gas research. b) Partnership with the United States could also help Latin America reduce CO2 emissions, protect tropical and temperate forests, and safeguard glaciers and water resources. Latin America abounds in natural resources and must take measures to protect them. c) Climate change and increasing concentration of the population will intensify the impact of natural disasters. Emergency preparedness requires effective institutions, first responder training, equipment acquisition, public education, and improved land use and construction standards. Latin American countries can take the initiative in these areas. Education, Science, and Technology Education, science, and technology help increase productivity and drive growth.Collaboration in these areas could focus on goods and services, with an emphasis on the use of information and communications technology.Latin American countries should propose innovative initiatives and explore areas of potential agreement, including: a) President Obama’s only quantitative proposal was to increase the number of US graduate students studying in Latin America to 100,000 and the number of Latin Americans studying in the United States to 100,000. To date, Asia has taken better advantage than Latin America of the academic excellence offered by US universities. New proposals designed to stimulate and fund these exchanges are needed. Chile’s 2008Becas Chile student aid program is a good example with much potential. b) Joint research in areas of importance to Latin America should be expanded. These include renewable energy, especially solar, biotechnology, and collaboration between Latin American and US businesses and research centers. A Rand Corporation report6 identifies 16 technology applications that will change living conditions in this decade and notes that some Latin American countries will be able to adopt them if they carry out certain policies and make a sustained effort. And it is important to remember that proficiency in English is an essential tool in a knowledge-based society. c) With respect to trade, the United States should move to eliminate barriers and open its market to Latin American products, especially foods. If WTO talks remain deadlocked, free trade agreements between the United States and Latin America should be expanded. There are serious political obstacles given the concern that such an approach would result in less employment in the United States. A more open global economy helps small and medium-sized countries whose development depends on exporting goods and services with increasing value-added. The 24 references to “partner” and “partnership” in President Obama’s Santiago speech should not remain empty talk. While some may interpret Obama’s logic of partnership as a sign of disinterest, I believe it reflects the new reality within which the United States will have to function. It falls to all Latin Americans to take a more active role in pursuing opportunities anddemanding that the United States make a firm commitment to its proposed new partnerships. Are Latin Americans prepared for this? Is there enough will in the United States to seek such partnerships? It is worth making a serious effort to see if this can work.<br/><br/>4. The challenge to all countries is to have a high- growth, low-carbon economy. <br/><br/>US Diplomacy solves warming, water scarcity, and proliferation <br/><br/>Hague 2k10 [William Hague, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and Member of Parliament for Richmond, United Kingdom, “The Diplomacy of Climate Change,” 9/27/10]<br/><br/>But I particularly wanted to make the point to this audience and to circulate to a wider audience certain points about climate change this morning, which is perhaps the 21st century's biggest foreign- policy challenge, along with preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. I believe those two threats over the longer term are the biggest threats to the peace and security of the world.¶ A world that is failing to respond to climate change is one in which the values embodied in the United Nations will not be met, and it's a world in which competition and conflict would win out over collaboration.¶ We're at a very crucial point in the global debate on this subject. Many people are questioning, in the wake of Copenhagen, whether we should continue to seek a response to climate change through the U.N. and whether we can ever hope to deal with this enormous challenge.¶ And I will first argue today that an effective response to climate change underpins our security and prosperity; second, that our response should be to strive for a binding global deal, whatever the setbacks; and third, I will set out why effective deployment of foreign policy assets is crucial to mobilizing the political will needed if we're going to shape an effective response.¶ Now, Ban Ki-moon is right to have made climate change his top priority. Two weeks ago, I was talking about Britain's values in a networked world. I said then that a successful response to climate change must be a central objective of British foreign policy. And I said this not only because I believe action against climate change is in line with a values-based foreign policy, but because it underpins our prosperity and security.¶ You can't have food, water or energy security without climate security; they are interconnected and inseparable. They form four resource pillars on which global security, prosperity and equity stand. Each depends on the other. Plentiful, affordable food requires reliable and affordable access to water and energy. Increasing dependence on coal, oil and gas threatens climate security, increasing the severity of floods and droughts, damaging food production, exacerbating the loss of biodiversity, and in countries that rely on hydropower, undermining energy security through the impact on the availability of water.¶ As the world becomes more networked, the impact of climate change in one country or region will affect the prosperity and security of others around the world.¶ No one can have failed to be appalled by the devastating floods in Pakistan. They overwhelmed the capacity of government to respond and opened political space for extremists. While Pakistan has borne the brunt of the human impact, China too has been hit on a vast scale by a seemingly endless sequence of droughts, floods and deadly mudslides. The Russian drought last month damaged the wheat harvest, leading to an export ban. World prices surged, hitting the poorest hardest, and sparking riots over bread prices in far away Mozambique.¶ While no one weather event can ever be linked with certainty to climate change, the broad patterns of abnormality seen this year are consistent with climate-change models. They provide an illustration of the events we will be encountering increasingly in the future.¶ So the clock is ticking, and the time to act is now. We must all take responsibility for this threat and take robust action. But we must also be clear-headed about the difficulties of reaching agreement and not lose heart when the going gets tough.¶ The post-war leaders set up the United Nations in the aftermath of conflagration. They saw the pressing need for global solutions to global problems: cooperation not conflict, through frameworks and institutions embedded in the rule of law, and an international system that is fair and offers everyone a realistic prospect of security and prosperity.¶ Failure to respond to climate change is inimical to all these values, undermining trust between nations, intensifying competition for resources, and shrinking the political space available for cooperation. It is an affront to fairness, since it puts the greatest burden on those who have done least to cause the problem and are least able to deal with its consequences.¶ It is incompatible with the values and aspirations that the U.N. embodies. And it's incompatible with the values and aspirations of British foreign policy.¶ For more than 20 years, we've been striving to build an effective international response to climate change. But we have lacked the collective ambition required. We need to shift investment urgently from high-carbon \"business as usual\" to the low-carbon economy. This means building an essentially decarbonized global economy by mid- century.¶ At the same time, we must ensure development is climate resilient; otherwise, the changes in climate that are already unavoidable will block the path for hundreds of millions of people from poverty to prosperity. These changes also threaten to sweep away the investments in development we have made, and just as the bridges and schools in Pakistan were swept away.¶ To drive that shift in investment from low to high carbon, we need a global climate change deal under the United Nations.¶ Now, some have argued that we should abandon hope of doing so. They say Copenhagen proved it's all too difficult; we should focus instead on less inclusive and less demanding responses, such as coalitions of the willing. But we believe this would be a strategic error. It mistakes the nature of the task, which is to expand the realm of the possible, not to lower our ambition by accepting its current limits.¶ And we must recognize this at Cancun. One thing Copenhagen did give us was a set of political commitments, captured in the Copenhagen Accord, on which we can build. More than 120 countries have now associated themselves with that accord, and that represents a broad and growing consensus. We now need to ensure that we live up to the commitments we made to each other in the accord, and reach out even more widely.¶ Copenhagen, despite those accords, was a strategic setback, but it was not by any means the end of the road. We need to be clear why it failed to live up to high expectations and why it did not deliver a legally binding deal.¶ Many people say that it failed because of process: The diplomats and the politicians had created a negotiation that was too difficult and too complex. But this misses the point. International treaties are an outcome, not an input, of political bargains. If you've made the political commitment to deliver, you can make the process work to deliver.¶ The real reason Copenhagen did not deliver on high expectations was a lack of political will. Many in developing countries saw a gap between the words and the deeds of the industrialized economies. They questioned whether we really believed our own rhetoric. And to answer those questions, we each need to start at home.¶ That is why the coalition government to which I belong has committed itself to being the greenest government ever in the United Kingdom, and why, with others in Europe, we are calling on the European Union to commit to a 30-percent cut in emissions by 2020 without waiting for the rest of the world to act.¶ The UK is already the world leader in offshore wind, with more projects installed, in planning and in construction than any other country in the world. We're undertaking the most radical transformation of our electricity sector ever. We aim to provide over 30 percent of our domestic electricity from renewables by 2020. We have committed to build no new coal-fired power stations without carbon capture and storage technology, and we've announced our intention to continue the demonstration projects of that.¶ And because it's imperative that foreign and domestic policies are mutually reinforcing, we must ensure that our approach is coherent. Now, that's one reason we have established the new British National Security Council: to ensure this happens across the full range of issues, including climate change.¶ And that's why I work hand in glove with Chris Huhne, the British Energy and Climate Change secretary, and Andrew Mitchell, the International Development secretary, to ensure that our domestic action reflects our level of international ambition.¶ But we won't succeed, of course, if we act alone. We must aim for a framework that is global and binding. It needs to be global because climate change affects everyone. Only a response that allows everyone a voice will generate a sense of common purpose and legitimacy. Only a response that is binding will convince investors that we intend to keep the promises we make to each other. Businesses need clear political signals, so let's show them an unequivocal green light.¶ We are now a few weeks away from the 16th Conference of Parties on Climate Change in Cancun. And I commend the consultative and collaborative approach Mexico has taken ahead of this meeting. Thanks to their determination and foresight, we have a chance in Cancun to regain momentum and make progress on key issues such as forests, technology, finance and transparency of commitments. Cancun will -- may not get us all the way to a full agreement, but it can put us back on track to one.¶ That said, the negotiations can't succeed inside a bubble. The negotiators in the U.N. process can't themselves build political will. They have to operate on the basis of current political realities in the countries they represent. And it's those realities that limit the ambition that we can set in the -- in such negotiations, and it's those realities that we now need to shift.¶ There is no global consensus on what climate change puts at risk, geopolitically and for the global economy, and thus on the scale and urgency of the response we need. We must build a global consensus if we are to guarantee our citizens security and prosperity. That is a job for foreign policy.¶ A fundamental purpose here for foreign policy is to shift the political debate, to create the political space for leaders and negotiators to reach agreement. We didn't get that right before Copenhagen, and we must get it right now.¶ So we urgently need to mobilize foreign ministers and the diplomats they lead, as well as institutions such as the Council on Foreign Relations, to put climate change at the heart of foreign- policy thinking.¶ When I became foreign secretary in May, I said the core goals of our foreign policy were to guarantee Britain's security and prosperity. Robust global action on climate change is essential to that agenda. That is why the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, under my leadership, is a vocal advocate for climate diplomacy. All British ambassadors carry the argument for a global low-carbon transition in their breast pocket or in their handbag. Climate change is part of their daily vocabulary, alongside the traditional themes of foreign policy. And they're supported by our unique network of climate attaches throughout the world.¶ The core assets of foreign policy are its networks and its convening power. Foreign policy can build political impulses to overcome barriers between sectors and cultures. In a networked world, diplomacy builds partnerships beyond government. And nowhere are those partnerships more vital than on climate.¶ So we must mobilize all our networks, not just across government but between governments, using organizations such as the Commonwealth as well. We must reach out, beyond, to NGOs, faith groups and businesses. And of all these, perhaps business engagement is the key to making a difference. It's business that will lead low-carbon transition. It's business that best understands the incentives needed to help us all prosper.¶ We must also harness scientific expertise in cutting-edge low- carbon technologies. The scientific community will develop the goods which will power the low-carbon economy and drive global ambition on climate change. And that's why the British government has a science and innovation network, which fosters collaborative research in the U.K. and other countries.¶ Now, what can the U.K. and the European Union do to make that fundamental shift and shape a global consensus on climate change? The most serious problem at Copenhagen, and the strongest brake on political will, was and is a lack of confidence in the low-carbon economy. Too few people in too few countries are yet convinced that a rapid move to low carbon is compatible with economic recovery and growth. They see the short-term economic and domestic stability risks before the opportunities and the longer-term risks of inaction.¶ There should be only one European response to that confidence gap. The EU, in my view, must accelerate its own progress and demonstrate that a low-carbon growth path makes us more competitive. I am convinced this is in the long-term interests of Europe's economy. We have learned painful lessons from the oil price shocks. We must modernize our infrastructure. The opportunities are out there. The global industry in low-carbon and environmental goods and services is already estimated to be worth up to 3.2 trillion pounds a year. Nearly a million British people are now employed in this sector, and that's why we are creating a green investment bank to ensure that we can properly support and develop low-carbon industry.¶ But we need to redouble our efforts, both in the EU (itself ?) and in our engagement with partners. Each of us as member states will be better able to accelerate if we're doing so together as the world's largest single market. And by opening up this effort through partnership with others, we can make it easier for them to accelerate, too.¶ So we'll be at the forefront of pushing for low-carbon modernization of Europe's infrastructure and energy policy. The European Union's budget until 2013 is set out in the current \"financial perspective\".¶ We will argue -- we will need to agree the financial perspective for the seven years after that, the period including our 2020 climate goals. And it's -- as ever, it's right that the EU budget should reflect the prevailing economic circumstances. It's also right that we direct the budget to today's challenges, not those of yesterday. And that means one that supports the transition to a low-carbon economy.¶ Action in Europe alone will not be enough. We need both the developed and developing world to take action. And this week Guido Westerwelle, the German foreign minister, and I have tasked our teams to come together to shape a coordinated, diplomacy-led effort on climate change, combining the strengths of our respective foreign services.¶ I've just put the case for bringing a new urgency for low-carbon transition within the EU. But together we should carry that urgency in external dialogues, whether they are with the United States, China or India.¶ The transition to low carbon will happen faster and maximize the benefit for all if the United States -- historically the world's largest emitter -- is at the leading edge. I recognize the political challenges that the U.S. administration faces and welcome President Obama's commitment to combat climate change. As he said in his State of the Union speech, \"the nation that leads the clean-energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy.\"¶ Whatever the outcome of the upcoming midterm elections in the U.S., there is scope for political unity around an economic agenda that targets new energy opportunities and new jobs. American business understands this new market and should want to lead it. But to make these new clean-energy investments at the required pace and on a sufficient scale, they need the right incentives.¶ On climate, as in so many areas, the world looks to the US for leadership, because it has the economic clout and diplomatic leverage to shift the global debate.¶ And I look forward to working with the U.S. administration and indeed with the Council on Foreign Relations to raise global ambitions and put us back on the path to sustainable growth.¶ A key challenge for Europe is to build an economic partnership with China that reinforces the steps China is taking towards a low- carbon economy. These steps include its recent announcement of the five provinces and eight cities that have been designated as China's low-carbon pilots. Together these pilots cover 350 million people, so an ambitious approach to these schemes, tenaciously implemented, could provide a critical boost to global confidence in the concept of low- carbon development and help put China on the path to sustainable prosperity.¶ It could also produce huge two-way investment and partnership opportunities. Europe should place itself at the heart of these, working with China to maximize the ambition and the opportunities and to build the shared technology standards that will shape a global low- carbon market.¶ In China's case, low-carbon opportunity is matched by urgent low- carbon need. The pace of growth in China means average Chinese per- capita emissions could soon eclipse those of Europe. So while China has taken some very welcome steps, without a commitment from China to further decisive action, the efforts of others will be in vain.¶ The emerging economies face a dilemma. Often they are the most vulnerable to the direct effects of climate change. But they are concerned that action against climate change will adversely affect their development. The challenge to all countries is to have a high- growth, low-carbon economy. Some, like Brazil, which derives nearly half its energy from clean and renewable resources, are rising to that challenge.¶ India is another, embodying in microcosm the challenge that climate change poses to us all. Threatened by food, water and energy insecurity, India has responded with ambitious plans to generate 20 gigawatts of solar power by 2022.¶ South Africa, a coal-dependent economy, the success of which is so important to growth and prosperity within the continent, has made a significant offer to deviate their emissions from the business-as- usual pathway.¶ The opportunity is for the emerging economies -- for the emerging economies is to make a direct leap to low carbon, avoiding the high- carbon lock-in that we see in the developed world: a new, sustainable pathway for prosperity and security. A global low-carbon economy is not an idealist's pipe dream but a 21st-century realist's imperative. Countries that adapt quickly to a carbon-constrained world will be better able to deliver lasting prosperity for their citizens. As a Permanent Security Council member, I'm determined that the U.K. will play its full part in that, not least by supporting climate finance for the poorest.¶ Collectively, we share a responsibility to those most vulnerable to the impact of climate change. Bangladesh, with its densely populated coastal region, is particularly susceptible to rising sea levels. Glacial melt, sea-level rises and El Nino-type events threaten the lives of millions across South America. And the very existence of many small island states is under threat.¶ We have a shared vision to meet the Millennium Development Goals. But in a world without action on climate change, that vision will remain a dream, and the efforts of the last 10 years would¶ So climate change is one of the gravest threats to our security and prosperity. Unless we take robust and timely action to deal with it, no country will be immune to its effects. However difficult it might seem now, a global deal under the U.N. is the only response to this threat which will create the necessary confidence to drive a low- carbon transition.¶ We must be undaunted by the scale of the challenge.¶ We must continue to strive for agreement. We must not accept that because there is no consensus on a way forward now, that there never will be one. And to change the debate, we must imaginatively deploy all of the foreign policy assets in our armory until we've shaped that global consensus.¶  A successful response to climate change will not only stabilize the climate, but open the way to a future in which we can meet our needs through cooperation, in accordance with the ideals of the United Nations. Failure to do so will enhance competitive tendencies and make the world more dangerous, so this is not actually a hard choice.¶ We have to get this right. If we do, we can still shape our world. And if we don't, the world will determine our destiny for us.<br/><br/>5.

Latin Americans find the idea of building a wall on the US-Mexico border particularly offensive .Despite bitter political battles over immigration in the United States, there is general agreement about what sensible reform would include . It combines effective border and employer enforcement, the adoption of a general worker program consistent with labor market needs in the United States, and a path toward residence and citizenship for the estimated 12 million unauthorized residents living in the country . This package is similar to the reform effort (unfortunately defeated in Congress) proposed under President George W . Bush .The complicated and divisive politics of the United States, compounded by the weakness of the US economy, have so far blocked this comprehensive approach . But more limited measures such as the Dream Act, allowing children brought to the United States without appropriate documentation an opportunity to qualify for citizenship, would not only be welcomed in US Latino communities and in Latin America, but it would demonstrate that the issue is being taken seriously and with a measure of compassion in Washington .Sensible US immigration policies promise to benefit the US economy .Migrants make up a significant percentage of younger workers . Their presence would improve the labor demographic and increase the US capacity for economic growth even while their contributions help sustain the US social security system . Immigration reform would also recognize the growing “Latinoamericanization” of the United States . Roughly one sixth of the population is currently of Latino descent . The cultural, demographic and family ties of those 50 million people will continue to deepen . The United States’ inability to respond to the policy challenge of immigration will have increasingly negative consequences, standing in the way of a more productive relationship with Latin America"
